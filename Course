Offensive Penetration Testing is a new course available to the security community. This intermediate course offers a detailed and comprehensive approach for assessing organizational vulnerabilities. Offensive testing is focused on "gaining access" through technical exploitation, in contrast to other penetration testing approaches that focus on defeating logical security controls.We believe that offensive penetration testing provides invaluable information about how an attacker might interact with your organization's networks, systems and applications. It also provides valuable insights into where your organization's most critical vulnerabilities lie, which can be used to identify potential ways to improve your overall information security posture. The course focuses on practical exercises and hands-on learning rather than theoretical methodology.

We provide our students with real-world examples from the field and exercises designed to offer training in all topics that are required to take on more complex and advanced assessments.Offensive penetration testing will help you learn how to conduct a successful pentesting engagement, including reconnaissance, enumeration, exploitation, privilege escalation, and post-exploitation.

• Processes, Procedures, and Ethics — what we expect from our students
• Host Exploitation — what are the typical attacks against Linux/Unix hosts
• Advanced Network Attacks — exploiting weaknesses of network protocols
• System Hacking – breaking into operating systems on compromised hosts using techniques like password cracking, gaining root privileges, etc.
