## I am Jsteves i manage a personal website. 

I help people to manage their stress and manage their weight, helping them to eat healthy and manage their stress. I train people to manage their stress, training them to manage their feelings of anxiety and depression - allowing them to live their lives with less stress. I listen to what my clients tell me about their stress levels, and I tailor a treatment plan based on their feedback! I work with people from all walks of life, so I can cater to any individual I work with.

From checking accounts to savings, credit cards, and more, personal finances can be tricky. My mission is to make it simple to manage everything from one place.


### Here from my customers
I've used all of the personal finance apps on the market, and found that most have a hard time syncing my various bank accounts and cards real-time, leaving me guessing sometimes for days. Blick was a pleasant surprise! The team has really worked hard to ensure instant syncronization with most of the mainstream banks and lenders. Impressed!

I rely on my budgeting spreadsheet since it helps me organize my spending data into meaningful charts and tables. That's why I've been comprehensive about switching to a personal finance app, as I found that the data presentation was usually lacking at best. Lo and behold, Blick was the only app that made the cut!
